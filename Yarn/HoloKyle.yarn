Hi. I’m Kyle. I work just a couple of floors directly up from here. 
I just thought I’d check in on you and make sure your first day is going ok. 
Are you excited to be working for Tough Guy Mountain?
->Yes
    Of course. Tough Guy Mountain is a very special place!
->No
    Of course. Tough Guy Mountain is... a very special place. 
What should I call you?

In fact, what are you doing outside the building? Why are you in a Cococo?

    You’re in the Brandscape. Brandzone 1a to be specific.
    <<jump page21questions>>

    This is the TGM Corporate HQ. You can access the lobby through the door ahead of you.
    <<jump page21questions>>
->What’s a Cococo?
    It stands for Collective Consciousness Co-Habitation. 
    It means there might be someone inside this body with you.
    <<jump page21questions>>
->I don’t have any questions. I’d like to go inside.

Well if you are an intern now, it’s appropriate that you’re in Intern Purgatory.
It’s also appropriate that you’ve stopped being naked.
I suppose I should be a good Holographic assistant and show you around your live/work cubicle.
Let’s start the tour! Click on some of this stuff!

A dutiful intern prefers to stand.
But we recognize the opportunity to extract valuable labor from the intern’s recreation moments as well.
That’s why we make sure you’re comfortable in your live/workspace.

This is the only way out of the cubicle.
Well, you could jump off the cubicle’s edge but I don’t recommend it.
Right now the door opens up to nothing, but if your supervisor wants to send you somewhere,
you’ll get an email that contains a downloadable location file.
So don’t worry, you aren’t trapped here forever ever!

This is where the real intern magic happens.
This is where the unpaid intern does their labor.
This is where the intern develops their personal brand.
New interns (like you) work on their personal brand until instructed otherwise.
Your console comes equipped with all the software you need to succeed.

I don’t know why there’s a jar of used cigarettes.
There’s an urban legend about “nightshift interns”.
Apparently, they come while you’re sleeping and use your computer.
I think that’s just a story interns tell each other to be spooky.

Welcome to intern purgatory!
My name is intern...
Intern Stan!
I know you already have Holographic Kyle to show you around,
so I’ll just be chiming in from time to time
to give you an intern perspective!

Don’t trust anyone who is messaging you.
Not even me.

It was a pleasure to meet you earlier, {$username}
I hope you don’t mind if we exchange correspondences from time to time?
->Yes
    Great. I’m sure you’ll hear from me soon. Take good care of my coverall.
->No
    Have we gotten off on the wrong foot?
    That’s unfortunate, but not a major obstacle.
    I’ll leave some words in your inbox from time to time.
    What you do with those words is up to you!

Huh?! That’s not the story you were supposed to be told.
That's a load of baseless rumours!
I’m not quite clear on how that got into your intern manual.
If you want the official, verified story, you can check out the bios for Joan Popular and Ivan Phone in the TGM database.
I’m going to look into what’s going wrong.
Maybe you should stop reading until I can find out where these stories are coming from.

If you enjoyed that, wait until you see what I’ve got for you next!
->Who are you?
    I'm just a humble intern,
    working to make TGM a better place.
->Why are you sending me these stories?
    In my experience, people don’t do well when they’re starved for information.
    We’re so used to getting a lot of information all the time.
    When you don’t get enough information on a subject you're interested in,
    your brain tends to speculate and make the rest up.
    I just like sending people enough information so that they can make informed decisions.

Hi! I’m Lisa. Is it your first day too?
->No
    Oh come on, I know a fresh intern when I see one ;)
->Yes
     It’s nice to make a friend, especially one going through something similar.
    This is a very strange workplace.
    I hope your cubicle is close to mine and we drift by each other at some point.
    Until then, let’s keep in touch.
    It’s not easy just being by yourself, working on your personal brand.
->Drifting cubicle?
    Yeah...Wait are you not in Intern Purgatory? Where are you?
->I don’t know… outside a giant pyramid?
    Huh. I guess not all unpaid internships are created equal.
    Every other intern I’ve met has been in a floating cubicle, just like me!
    Maybe you’re special? Keep me in the loop. Nice to meet you!

That is, if your cubicles ever happen to cross paths.

Hey! I just got a promotion! Or like a re-assignment?
I’m working all the way up in the Brass Offices on some campaign called “After Now”.
I don’t know much about it yet but it sounds like a lot of work.
Mind if I bounce some ideas off you from time to time?
->I don’t mind at all
    Thanks {$username}! You’re the best intern in this whole office.
->Actually I do mind.
    Haha {$username}! You’re a spicy intern!

You can’t trust what that app or map tells you.
Most of the TGM is hidden.

What was that?!
You definitely weren’t supposed to see that.
I'm asking you to stop reading.
That IP was stolen from a high-up exec.
You’ve been exposed to compromised IP.
If your supervisors find out, there could be consequences.
Look, I don’t want you to get in trouble.
It’s not your fault the onboarding process is so wonky right now.
I’m going to figure out what’s going on.
But please don’t read any more material until I do.

Whatever you learned about “Stephen Wrobbs”
is probably just a doctored, fake piece of intellectual property.
I don’t think Stephen Wrobbs even exists!.
You wouldn’t want to get on his bad side though,
so the best thing to do is probably give it back
and pretend you didn’t see anything!

Hey.
I got word that Holographic Kyle was going to report you to the higher-ups because your onboarding process went wonky.
I didn’t want to see anything bad happen to you so… I reset his program.
Look… I know you didn’t ask for any of this, but TGM is a very strange place,
so whatever you do with this info, whatever you do with the rest of your unpaid internship…
just promise me you’ll be careful, okay?
Help me out on this After Now campaign and we’ll call it even.
Well I’ve got to get back to work.
Good luck Intern! Don’t let this place swallow you up!

If you see a picture of me, in the corner of  this onboarding manual, look at it through your peripatetic.
I’m sure to have some helpful hints and company secrets!
Good luck! Mr. Phone should be with you any minute.
